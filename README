# todo
- check for 'dst' folder
- check that the qt-fuse-example client meets all FUSE QA requirements
- add pthread (say read(..) to QThread communication)

# what is this?
qt-fuse-example is a lightweight example for how to use FUSE and Qt together. 

# features
 * POSIX signal handling, so that CTRL+C from a shell can be used to shutdown the program gracefully
 * FUSE runs in its own thread/QThread and thus does not affect the main gui thread of Qt -
   but pressing CTRL+C will shutdown the FUSE thread, unmounts the FS and cleanly exists qt-fuse-example.
 * 'fusermount -u dst' cleanly shutdowns qt-fuse-example
 * if 'dst' is still mounted but qt-fuse-example, which opened it crashed, qt-fuse-example will unmount it automatically on program start
 * in case 'dst' is still mounted on qt-fuse-example start it will unmount it automatically
 * a minimal read only FUSE FS so that one can see some files using 'ls -la' on the shell. 

# dependencies
 * Qt 4.x
 * FUSE library

# how to compile
 * qmake
 * make
 
# how to use 

## start the software (from a shell)
you need the hardcoded 'dst' path:
mkdir dst
./qt-fuse-example 

## exit the daemon
on the shell you started qt-fuse-example from, hit:
 - hit CTRL+C 

or use:
 - kill `pidof qt-fuse-example`

both commands will shutdown qt-fuse-example gracefully.

in case it crashes, shoot the process with:
  kill -9 `pidof qt-fuse-example`

afterwards remote the mount:
  fusermount -u dst
