# todo
- make clean; make (fix all warnings)
- check that the qt-fuse-example client meets all FUSE QA requirements
 - check all printf/cout/qDebug lines
 - check for errors when doing fuse function calls
 - [x] check that all required functions are called on shutdown
  
# what is this?
qt-fuse-example is a lightweight example for how to use FUSE and Qt together. 

# features
 * POSIX signal handling, so that CTRL+C from a shell can be used to shutdown the program gracefully
   - this is the primary reason why fuse_main(..) can't be used since one needs to inject into the POSIX signal handlers:
     QFuse.cpp - QFuse::shutDown() is called when a POSIX signal arrives, doing a clean shutdown
 * FUSE runs in its own FUSE-eventloop (f
 use_loop/fuse_loop_mt) started from a QThread in QFuse.cpp, thus both loops are isolated from each other
 * pressing CTRL+C will shutdown the FUSE-eventloop, unmounts the FS and cleanly exists qt-fuse-example.
 * 'fusermount -u dst' cleanly shuts down the FUSE-eventloop and also cleandly exists the qt-fuse-example
 * if 'dst' is still mounted but qt-fuse-example, which opened it crashed, qt-fuse-example will unmount it automatically on program start
 * this implementation features the hello.c minimal read only FUSE FS coming with the fuse library source
   - there exists only one file called 'hello'
   - and it contains "Hello World!"
 * command line arguments are parsed using fuse_parse_cmdline(..)
 - '-s' single vs multithreaded
 - '-d' enabled/disable debug
 - mountpoint (still 'mnt' is a default if nothing is given)

# dependencies
 * Qt 4.x
 * FUSE library 2.9.x

# how to compile
 * qmake
 * make
 
# how to use 

## start the software (from a shell)
you need the hardcoded 'dst' path:
mkdir dst
./qt-fuse-example 

or

usage:
  ./qt-fuse-example --help  
example: 
  ./qt-fuse-example dst -d -s

## exit the daemon
on the shell you started qt-fuse-example from, hit:
 - hit CTRL+C 

or use:
 - kill `pidof qt-fuse-example`

both commands will shutdown qt-fuse-example gracefully.

in case it crashes, shoot the process with:
  kill -9 `pidof qt-fuse-example`

afterwards remote the mount:
  fusermount -u dst
